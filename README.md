# NodeOS initramfs

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/NodeOS/nodeos-initramfs.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This package generate a initramfs image that will try to mount the users
filesystem, set on the `root=` flag on Linux command line. If it fails to do so,
it boots to a Node.js [REPL](http://nodejs.org/api/repl.html) prompt using an
on-memory root filesystem.

## Note about *env.js*

Since `/usr/bin/env` is also a Node.js script, to use less memory and boot
faster it's checking that the script to be run is already a Node.js script and
if so, it `require()`s it and exec it directly to re-use the current Node.js
instance. This has the drawback that Python-inspired tricks like
`!module.parent` or `require.main === module` will not work anymore. A better
alternative and currently more widely used when a package can be used both as a
library and as an executable is to define the executable at an independent
script file and use the `package.json` *main* and *bin* entries.
